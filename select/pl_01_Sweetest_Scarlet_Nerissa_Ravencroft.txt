My sweetest scarlet,
my sweetest scarlet
My sweetest scarlet,
my sweetest scarlet
Lookin' to find the words
to tell you
This feeling's brand-new,
I'm trying to make do
Still I can feel
my heart is trembling
You got me lost
inside the groove
Wishing you would make a move
'Cause I can't even look away
Your eyes are shining,
still there's something
that you're hiding
Won't you tell me
with warmth of your lips
How you found me was lonely
Then you filled my heart up,
wholly
Let me know, let me know,
let me know what keeps you
smiling by my side
If above or below me
Baby you're my one and only
Let me show, let me show,
let me show you I can love you
through the night, yeah
My sweetest scarlet,
my sweetest scarlet
Baby, you're on my mind
all of the time
Yeah, you plus me
I can get behind
My sweetest scarlet,
my sweetest scarlet
Truly, you got my heart,
right from the start -
you fill me with your love
Standing with you
beneath the moonlight
(you're dazzling)
Although it's midnight
(you got me babbling),
you're shining so bright
(glad it's happening)
Longing to have you
through the cold night
I've already fallen victim
to your charm
Stop delaying,
hold me close and warm
We'll melt into each other arms
Don't need permission,
my decisions already made clear
You could feel it
from the moment we kissed
How you found me was lonely
Then you filled my heart up,
wholly
Let me know, let me know,
let me know what keeps you
smiling by my side
If above or below me
Baby you're my one and only
Let me show, let me show,
let me show you I can love you
through the night, yeah
My sweetest scarlet,
my sweetest scarlet
Ooo la la la
My sweetest scarlet,
my sweetest scarlet
Just want you to hold me,
darling
'Cause how you found me
was lonely
Then you filled my heart up,
wholly
Let me know, let me know,
let me know what keeps you
smiling by my side
If above or below me
Baby you're my one and only
Let me show, let me show,
let me show you I can love you
through the night, yeah
My sweetest scarlet,
my sweetest scarlet
Baby, you're on my mind
all of the time
Yeah, you plus me I can
get behind
My sweetest scarlet,
my sweetest scarlet
Truly, you got my heart,
right from the start -
you fill me with your love
My sweetest scarlet,
my sweetest scarlet
My sweetest scarlet,
my sweetest scarlet
